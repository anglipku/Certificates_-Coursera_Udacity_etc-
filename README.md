# Certificates_-Coursera_Udacity_etc-
These are the certificates I earned by passing courses on learning platforms including Coursera, Udacity etc.  
I think these courses supplement my graduate study very well.

Right now, certificates from these courses are in the list

1. Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce, by Udacity, completed on Oct, 2015
2. Financial Engineering and Rish Management, Part I, completed on Feb, 2016

And the list will grow ...
